# OpenSource Bread Roll Maker machine

The problem: the actual bread machines make breads of 500 grams (even the ones that uses capsules like the Sunbeam® Easy Bread®: http://www.sunbeam.ca/) but the bread roll buy and eat weights 50 grams. The bread get dry and hard after some hours, unless it is made on the momment.

The idea: a machine that makes a bread roll (small bread) very quick and have as input a capsule - think of it as the capsules coffee machine but for bread rolls.
Advantages: have a hot, fresh and soft bread roll at any time and in just a few seconds!!
