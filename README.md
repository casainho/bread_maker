# OpenSource Bread Roll Maker machine

**The problem:** the actual bread machines make breads of 500 grams (even the ones that uses capsules like the [Sunbeam® Easy Bread®:](http://www.sunbeam.ca/) but the bread roll that I buy and eat, weighs 50 grams. Unless it had been made on the moment, it is hard and not good to eat - because it dries just after some hours, .

**The idea:** a machine that makes a bread roll (small bread) very quick and have as input a capsule - think of it as the capsules coffee machine but for bread rolls.
Advantages: have a fresh and hot, soft bread roll at any time and that takes just a few seconds to bake!!

# How could it be done

NOTE: I am just a curious, I do not have any knowledge about how to make bread.

**Idea:** the bread have 50 grams and the dough may need to have 75 grams. The dough would be inside a capsule and would be opened at the start of baking inside the machine. The machine would use microwaves and bake just as the famous microwave instant chocolate cake.

I can think of [RepRap 3D Printers project](http://reprap.org/), that develops complex 3D Printers as Open Source and community project.
